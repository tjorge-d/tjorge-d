## Be Welcome!

### Who am I?
  My name is Tiago and currently im studying at 42 Lisboa.<br>
  
### What are my hobbies?
  Since kid, I was that little gremlin anxiously waiting to get home and play some **videogames** :video_game:. That grown into me and now its an hobby that healthily relaxes me after a long and busy day.<br>
  After my first job, I decided to gather some pennies and buy myself a **Camera** :camera:. It is an essential part of my life, being able to freely capture moments that will be immortalized and reviewed in the future.<br>
  Like any normal person, I also love hanging out and share experiences with my friends and family.<br>
  
### What was I doing before programming?
  In the beggining I was assisting a **theater** :japanese_goblin: with all sorts of tasks like managing guests, promoting shows or working in backstage operations.<br>
  Later on, I had the opportunity to work in the naval industry inspecting **ships** :ship:. The time passed and I found myself traveling around the globe leading teams and sailing with cruises. That's when I decided to change my career and get myself some time to spend with my family and friends, delving into an area that I was always curious of, **Programming** :computer:.<br>
